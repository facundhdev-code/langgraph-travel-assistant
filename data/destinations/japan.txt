DESTINATION: Japan

  VISA: Citizens of most Western countries (USA, EU, Argentina, etc.) do NOT need a visa for stays up to 90 days. Entry requires a valid passport. No tourist visa fee. As of 2024, Japan has a tourist tax of
  1000 yen per person collected at departure.

  BEST TIME TO VISIT: March-May (cherry blossom season, mild weather) and October-November (autumn foliage, cool temperatures). Avoid July-August (hot, humid, crowded) and Golden Week (late April-early May,
  very crowded).

  CURRENCY: Japanese Yen (JPY). Japan is still largely cash-based — carry cash at all times. ATMs at 7-Eleven and Japan Post accept foreign cards. Budget: ~10,000-15,000 yen/day for mid-range travel.

  LANGUAGE: Japanese. English signage in major tourist areas and train stations. Staff at major hotels speak English. Learning basic phrases (arigatou, sumimasen) is appreciated.

  CULTURAL TIPS:
  - Remove shoes when entering homes, many ryokans, and some restaurants
  - Do not tip — it can be considered rude
  - Queue patiently and quietly in lines
  - Avoid eating or drinking while walking
  - Tattoos may be prohibited in onsens (hot spring baths)
  - Trash bins are rare — carry your garbage with you
  - Bow slightly when greeting or thanking someone

  TRANSPORTATION: Extensive and punctual rail network. JR Pass recommended for multi-city trips (buy before arriving). IC cards (Suica, Pasmo) for local trains and buses — rechargeable and widely accepted.
  Shinkansen (bullet trains) connect major cities. Taxis are expensive.

  SAFETY: One of the safest countries in the world. Extremely low crime rate. Natural disaster risk: earthquakes and typhoons (June-September). Follow evacuation instructions if an alert sounds.
