DESTINATION: United Kingdom

  VISA: EU citizens need a valid passport (no longer just an ID post-Brexit) for stays up to 6 months — no visa required. USA, Canada, Australia, Argentina, and most Western countries do NOT need a visa for
  stays up to 6 months. Citizens of many other countries need an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) or visa — check the UK government website.

  BEST TIME TO VISIT: May-September. Longest days and warmest weather (though still mild — 15-22°C in London). June-August is peak tourist season. April-May and September-October offer good weather with fewer
  crowds. Winter is cold, grey, and rainy but Christmas atmosphere in London and Edinburgh is magical.

  CURRENCY: British Pound Sterling (GBP). Cards accepted almost everywhere — the UK is nearly cashless. Contactless payment standard. Budget: ~100-200 GBP/day for mid-range travel in London; significantly less
   outside the capital.

  LANGUAGE: English. Welsh in Wales, Scottish Gaelic in parts of Scotland. Strong regional accents — Scots, Geordie, Scouse — can be challenging at first.

  CULTURAL TIPS:
  - Queuing is sacred — jumping a queue is a serious social offense
  - "Sorry" is used constantly and means many different things
  - Pub culture is central to British social life — rounds (buying drinks for the group) are expected
  - Tipping: 10-12.5% in restaurants, not expected in pubs
  - Don't discuss money, politics, or religion on first meeting
  - Understatement is a national art form — "not bad" often means excellent

  TRANSPORTATION: Extensive rail network connecting all major cities — book in advance for cheapest fares (Trainline, Avanti, LNER). London has the Underground (Tube) — use an Oyster card or contactless.
  National Express coaches for budget travel. Domestic flights useful for London-Scotland. Driving on the LEFT.

  SAFETY: Very safe. One of the lowest crime rates in Europe. Petty theft possible in London tourist areas (Piccadilly Circus, Oxford Street) and on crowded public transport. Emergency number: 999.
