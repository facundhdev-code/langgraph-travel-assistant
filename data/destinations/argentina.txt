DESTINATION: Argentina

  VISA: Citizens of USA, EU, Canada, Australia, and most of Latin America do NOT need a visa. Entry requires a valid passport. Stay up to 90 days, renewable once for another 90 days. No tourist fee currently
  (the reciprocity fee was eliminated).

  BEST TIME TO VISIT: Patagonia: November-March (austral summer). Buenos Aires: March-May and September-November (mild, less humid). Avoid Buenos Aires in January-February (hot, humid, many locals on
  vacation). Mendoza wine region: March-April (harvest season).

  CURRENCY: Argentine Peso (ARS). As of 2024-2025, Argentina has a unified official exchange rate. Use credit/debit cards widely — they apply the official rate. ATM withdrawals have daily limits and fees. USD
  cash is widely accepted and can be exchanged at banks and exchange houses (casas de cambio).

  LANGUAGE: Spanish (River Plate dialect — "vos" instead of "tú", distinctive Italian-influenced accent). English spoken in Buenos Aires hotels and tourist areas. Outside Buenos Aires, Spanish is essential.

  CULTURAL TIPS:
  - Dinner is eaten late — restaurants fill up after 9pm, many Argentines eat at 10-11pm
  - Asado (barbecue) is a social ritual, not just a meal — accept any invitation
  - Mate (herbal drink) is shared from the same gourd — it is a gesture of friendship
  - Greet with a kiss on the cheek (even between men in some regions)
  - Tipping is customary in restaurants: 10% is standard
  - Argentines are warm and talkative — small talk and conversation are valued

  TRANSPORTATION: Buenos Aires has an extensive subway (Subte) and bus (colectivo) network — use the SUBE card. Long-distance buses are comfortable and affordable (cama class for overnight). Domestic flights
  (Aerolíneas Argentinas, JetSMART) connect major destinations. Renting a car is ideal for Patagonia and wine regions.

  SAFETY: Buenos Aires is generally safe in tourist areas (Palermo, Recoleta, San Telmo). Avoid showing expensive phones or cameras on the street. Use radio taxis or Uber/Cabify over street taxis. Some areas
  (La Boca outside the main tourist street, certain suburbs) require extra caution at night.
