DESTINATION: Mexico

  VISA: Citizens of USA, Canada, EU, UK, Australia, Argentina, and most of Latin America do NOT need a visa. Entry requires a valid passport. Tourist card (FMM) issued on arrival — keep it, you need it to
  exit. Stay up to 180 days.

  BEST TIME TO VISIT: November-April (dry season). December-March is peak for beach destinations (Cancún, Los Cabos, Puerto Vallarta). Mexico City is pleasant year-round. Avoid June-October on the Gulf and
  Caribbean coasts (hurricane season). Día de los Muertos (late October-early November) is a spectacular cultural experience.

  CURRENCY: Mexican Peso (MXN). USD widely accepted in tourist areas but you get better rates paying in pesos. Carry cash — many local restaurants, markets, and taxis don't accept cards. ATMs widely available.
   Budget: ~1,200-2,500 MXN/day (~$60-125 USD) for comfortable mid-range travel.

  LANGUAGE: Spanish. English spoken in major tourist resorts and Mexico City hotels. Outside tourist zones, Spanish is essential.

  CULTURAL TIPS:
  - Punctuality is relaxed — "ahorita" can mean anything from now to never
  - Tipping is expected: 10-15% in restaurants, 10-20 MXN per bag for hotel staff
  - Bargaining is normal at markets (mercados), not in malls or restaurants
  - Mezcal and tequila are cultural institutions — learn the difference
  - Spice levels in authentic food can be intense — ask "¿pica mucho?" (is it very spicy?)
  - Mexicans are extremely warm and hospitable — reciprocate with genuine interest in their culture

  TRANSPORTATION: Domestic flights for long distances (Mexico is vast). ADO and ETN luxury bus lines for intercity travel — comfortable and affordable. Mexico City has an extensive Metro. Uber available in
  major cities and safer than street taxis. Colectivos (shared minivans) for shorter regional routes.

  SAFETY: Research specific destinations before visiting. Tourist areas (Cancún hotel zone, Playa del Carmen, Mexico City tourist districts, Oaxaca) are generally safe. Avoid driving at night outside cities.
  Use Uber over street taxis in Mexico City. Keep a low profile and avoid displaying expensive jewelry or phones.
