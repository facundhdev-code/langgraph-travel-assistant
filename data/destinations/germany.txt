DESTINATION: Germany

  VISA: EU citizens need only an ID. USA, Canada, Australia, Argentina, and most Western countries do NOT need a visa for stays up to 90 days (Schengen Area). Other nationalities require a Schengen visa.

  BEST TIME TO VISIT: May-September for general sightseeing and outdoor activities. Late September-early October for Oktoberfest in Munich (book accommodation months in advance). November-December for the
  world-famous Christmas markets (Weihnachtsmärkte) in Nuremberg, Cologne, and Dresden. Winter outside Christmas markets is cold and grey.

  CURRENCY: Euro (EUR). Germany is more cash-oriented than other Western European countries — many restaurants, smaller shops, and markets are cash-only. Always carry euros. Budget: ~90-160 EUR/day for
  mid-range travel; Munich and Hamburg are the most expensive cities.

  LANGUAGE: German. English widely spoken in major cities, hotels, and tourist areas. Outside big cities, English proficiency drops. A few German phrases (Bitte, Danke, Entschuldigung) are well received.

  CULTURAL TIPS:
  - Rules and order matter — jaywalking, even when no cars are visible, is genuinely frowned upon
  - Punctuality is not just polite — it is expected in all contexts
  - Recycling is taken extremely seriously — learn the bin system (gelbe Sack, Altpapier, Restmüll)
  - Bread (Brot) is a cultural institution — Germany has over 3,000 registered bread varieties
  - Tipping: 10% in restaurants; round up for taxis
  - Sunday is still largely a day of rest — many shops are closed, supermarkets included
  - Do not make Nazi-related jokes or gestures — Holocaust denial and Nazi symbols are illegal

  TRANSPORTATION: Deutsche Bahn (DB) intercity trains — excellent but can be delayed; book in advance for best prices. ICE high-speed trains for long distances. S-Bahn and U-Bahn in all major cities. FlixBus
  for budget intercity travel. Excellent cycling infrastructure. Autobahn for driving — no general speed limit on many sections but traffic can be intense.

  SAFETY: Very safe. Low violent crime. Petty theft possible in busy train stations (Berlin Hauptbahnhof, Munich) and tourist areas. Keep bags close and be aware of your surroundings in crowded Christmas
  markets.
