 DESTINATION: Thailand

  VISA: Citizens of 65+ countries (USA, EU, UK, Australia, Argentina, etc.) receive a visa exemption on arrival — 60 days, extendable once for 30 more days at an immigration office. Other nationalities can
  apply for a tourist visa (TR) at a Thai embassy.

  BEST TIME TO VISIT: November-April (cool and dry season). Best beaches: Gulf of Thailand (Koh Samui, Koh Phangan) November-April; Andaman coast (Phuket, Krabi) December-April. Avoid May-October (monsoon
  season) — heavy rains and some islands become inaccessible.

  CURRENCY: Thai Baht (THB). Cash is king — carry Baht at all times. ATMs widely available but charge foreign withdrawal fees (~180-220 THB). Credit cards accepted in hotels and malls. Budget: ~1,500-3,000
  THB/day (~$40-85 USD) for comfortable mid-range travel.

  LANGUAGE: Thai. English widely spoken in tourist areas, hotels, and Bangkok. Outside tourist zones, communication can be difficult — translation apps are helpful.

  CULTURAL TIPS:
  - The monarchy is sacred — never criticize the king or royal family (it is illegal)
  - Remove shoes before entering temples and many homes
  - Dress modestly at temples — cover shoulders and knees; sarongs available at entrances
  - The head is sacred — never touch anyone's head
  - Feet are considered low — do not point them at people or sacred objects
  - The "wai" (hands pressed together, slight bow) is the respectful greeting
  - Bargaining is expected at markets — never at malls or restaurants

  TRANSPORTATION: Tuk-tuks and songthaews (shared taxis) for short distances. Grab app (like Uber) in Bangkok and major cities. BTS Skytrain and MRT Metro in Bangkok. Overnight sleeper trains for intercity
  travel. Domestic flights for long distances (Bangkok-Chiang Mai, Bangkok-Phuket). Ferries between islands.

  SAFETY: Generally safe for tourists. Scams targeting tourists are common (gem scam, tuk-tuk tour scam, "temple is closed today" scam). Only use licensed taxis with meters or Grab. Road traffic is the biggest
   safety risk — drive carefully and wear helmets on motorbikes.
