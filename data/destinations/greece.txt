DESTINATION: Greece

  VISA: EU citizens need only an ID. USA, Canada, Australia, Argentina, and most Western countries do NOT need a visa for stays up to 90 days (Schengen Area). Other nationalities require a Schengen visa.

  BEST TIME TO VISIT: May-June and September-October. Warm and sunny, fewer crowds, lower prices than peak season. July-August is peak: very hot (35-40°C), extremely crowded on the islands, and expensive.
  Winter is quiet and cheap but many island businesses close.

  CURRENCY: Euro (EUR). Cash still preferred on smaller islands and local tavernas. ATMs available on all major islands. Budget: ~80-150 EUR/day for mid-range travel; islands tend to be more expensive than the
   mainland.

  LANGUAGE: Greek. English widely spoken in tourist areas, hotels, and restaurants throughout the islands and Athens.

  CULTURAL TIPS:
  - Dress modestly when visiting Orthodox churches and monasteries (cover shoulders and knees)
  - Lunch is late (2-3pm) and dinner starts at 9pm or later
  - "Kefi" — the Greek spirit of joy and celebration — is real; embrace spontaneous music and dancing
  - Tipping is appreciated but not mandatory — 10% is standard
  - Haggling is acceptable at markets, not in shops or restaurants
  - The "evil eye" (mati) is a genuine cultural belief — blue eye amulets are not just souvenirs

  TRANSPORTATION: Domestic flights (Aegean Airlines, Sky Express) for island hopping if time is short. Ferries connect all major islands — book in advance in summer. Athens has a good Metro system. Renting a
  car or ATV is ideal for exploring islands and mainland regions. Taxis metered in cities.

  SAFETY: One of the safest countries in Europe. Very low violent crime. Petty theft rare but possible in Athens (Monastiraki, Omonia area). Sun and heat are the main dangers in summer — hydrate constantly and
   use sunscreen.
