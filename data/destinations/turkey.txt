DESTINATION: Turkey

  VISA: Citizens of many countries can obtain an e-Visa online before arrival (~$50-100 USD depending on nationality) — valid 30-90 days. EU citizens from some countries are visa-exempt. USA, Canada, and
  Australia require an e-Visa. Argentina is visa-exempt for 90 days. Always check current requirements at evisa.gov.tr before traveling.

  BEST TIME TO VISIT: April-May and September-October. Pleasant temperatures, fewer crowds. June-August is very hot (35-40°C in Istanbul and Cappadocia) but beaches (Antalya, Bodrum) are ideal. Winter is cold
  and rainy in Istanbul but Cappadocia in snow is spectacular.

  CURRENCY: Turkish Lira (TRY). Exchange rates fluctuate significantly — exchange money locally for best rates. Credit cards widely accepted in cities and tourist areas. Carry some cash for bazaars, street
  food, and smaller establishments. Budget: ~800-1,500 TRY/day (~$25-50 USD) — Turkey is excellent value for money.

  LANGUAGE: Turkish. English widely spoken in Istanbul tourist areas, hotels, and coastal resorts. Outside major tourist zones, English is limited — a few Turkish phrases are appreciated.

  CULTURAL TIPS:
  - Turkey is a predominantly Muslim country — dress modestly when visiting mosques (cover head, shoulders, and knees; remove shoes)
  - Haggling is expected and part of the culture in the Grand Bazaar and markets
  - Tea (çay) will be offered constantly — accepting is polite and a gesture of hospitality
  - Tipping: 10% in restaurants, small tip for hammam attendants
  - The Evil Eye (Nazar) is a genuine belief — blue amulets are everywhere
  - Men and women may be separated in some traditional restaurants — look for the "aile salonu" (family section)

  TRANSPORTATION: Turkish Airlines and Pegasus for domestic flights (Istanbul to Cappadocia, Antalya, etc.) — affordable and frequent. Intercity buses (FlixBus, Kamil Koç) comfortable and cheap. Istanbul has
  Metro, tram, and ferry — use the Istanbulkart. Taxis in Istanbul — use BiTaksi app to avoid scams. Dolmuş (shared minibus) for shorter routes.

  SAFETY: Generally safe in tourist areas. Istanbul, Cappadocia, and the Aegean/Mediterranean coast are well-trodden and safe. Avoid border regions near Syria and Iraq. Petty theft in the Grand Bazaar. Be
  cautious of carpet shop invitations that involve heavy sales pressure.
