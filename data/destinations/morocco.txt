DESTINATION: Morocco

  VISA: Citizens of USA, EU, UK, Canada, Australia, and Argentina do NOT need a visa — stay up to 90 days. Entry requires a valid passport with at least 6 months validity.

  BEST TIME TO VISIT: March-May and September-November. Mild temperatures, ideal for cities and the Sahara. June-August is extremely hot inland (40-45°C in Marrakech and Fes) — only the Atlantic coast
  (Essaouira, Agadir) is bearable. December-February is cool and pleasant in the cities; the Sahara is cold at night but stunningly clear.

  CURRENCY: Moroccan Dirham (MAD). Morocco has exchange controls — dirhams cannot be purchased outside the country. Exchange at airports or banks on arrival. Cash is essential — carry dirhams at all times.
  ATMs available in cities. Budget: ~500-900 MAD/day (~$50-90 USD) for comfortable mid-range travel.

  LANGUAGE: Arabic (Darija dialect) and Berber (Tamazight) are the native languages. French is widely used in business, government, and tourism. English is spoken in major tourist areas and riads. Spanish
  understood in the north (near Spain).

  CULTURAL TIPS:
  - Morocco is a Muslim country — dress modestly, especially women (cover shoulders and avoid short skirts/shorts in medinas)
  - Ramadan significantly changes daily life — many restaurants close during the day; be respectful
  - Bargaining is mandatory in the souks — start at 30-40% of asking price and enjoy the process
  - Tipping is expected: 10% in restaurants, 10-20 MAD for guides and drivers
  - Do not photograph people (especially women) without permission
  - Accepting mint tea is a sign of respect — refusing is rude; the first glass is bitter, the second sweet, the third like death (Berber saying)
  - Male travelers should be aware that some guides may make assumptions about female companions

  TRANSPORTATION: Royal Air Maroc and Air Arabia Maroc for domestic flights. ONCF trains connect Casablanca, Rabat, Fes, Marrakech, and Tangier — comfortable and reliable. CTM and Supratours buses for
  destinations not covered by trains. Grands taxis (shared long-distance taxis) for intercity. Petit taxis for city travel — always negotiate or insist on the meter. Renting a car ideal for the Atlas Mountains
   and Sahara routes.

  SAFETY: Generally safe for tourists in main cities and tourist circuits. Marrakech, Fes, Chefchaouen, and Essaouira are well-traveled and manageable. Faux guides (unofficial guides who offer help and then
  demand payment) are the main nuisance — politely decline unsolicited help. Solo female travelers should be prepared for persistent attention in some areas and dress conservatively. Keep valuables secure in
  the medinas.
