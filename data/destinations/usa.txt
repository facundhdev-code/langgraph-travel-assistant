DESTINATION: United States

  VISA: Citizens of 42 Visa Waiver Program countries (EU, UK, Australia, Japan, etc.) can apply for ESTA online (~$21, valid 2 years). Citizens of most Latin American countries (including Argentina, Brazil,
  Mexico) require a B-2 tourist visa — apply at the US Embassy well in advance. Canadian citizens need no visa.

  BEST TIME TO VISIT: Depends heavily on the region. New York: April-June and September-November. Florida: November-April (avoid hurricane season June-November). California: year-round, best April-October.
  National Parks: May-September.

  CURRENCY: US Dollar (USD). Credit and debit cards accepted everywhere. Tipping is mandatory in restaurants (18-20%), taxis (15%), and hotels (bellhop, housekeeping). Budget: varies enormously — $150-400+/day
   depending on city and lifestyle.

  LANGUAGE: English. Spanish widely spoken in Florida, Texas, California, and New York. No official national language.

  CULTURAL TIPS:
  - Tipping is not optional — it is part of the wage system for service workers
  - Sales tax is NOT included in displayed prices — add 5-10% at checkout
  - Portions are very large — sharing dishes is common and accepted
  - Small talk with strangers is normal and friendly, not intrusive
  - The drinking age is 21 — ID required everywhere
  - Healthcare is extremely expensive — travel insurance is strongly recommended

  TRANSPORTATION: Domestic flights are the main way to travel between cities (vast distances). Amtrak trains on the East Coast (NYC-Boston-Washington DC corridor is excellent). Renting a car is essential
  outside major cities. Uber/Lyft widely available. Public transit only reliable in NYC, Chicago, San Francisco, and Washington DC.

  SAFETY: Generally safe in tourist areas. Research specific neighborhoods before visiting. Healthcare costs are extremely high without insurance. Natural disaster risk varies by region: hurricanes
  (Southeast), tornadoes (Midwest), earthquakes (California).
