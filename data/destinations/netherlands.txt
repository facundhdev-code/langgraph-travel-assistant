 DESTINATION: Netherlands

  VISA: EU citizens need only an ID. USA, Canada, Australia, Argentina, and most Western countries do NOT need a visa for stays up to 90 days (Schengen Area). Other nationalities require a Schengen visa.

  BEST TIME TO VISIT: April-May (tulip season — Keukenhof gardens, iconic Dutch landscapes) and June-August (warmest months, long days). April is the sweet spot: tulips in bloom, fewer crowds than summer.
  September-October is pleasant and less crowded. Winter is cold, grey, and rainy but the Christmas markets and ice skating are charming.

  CURRENCY: Euro (EUR). Netherlands is nearly cashless — cards and contactless accepted almost everywhere. Some markets and small businesses still prefer cash. Budget: ~100-180 EUR/day for mid-range travel in
  Amsterdam; less in smaller cities.

  LANGUAGE: Dutch. English is spoken by virtually everyone — Netherlands has one of the highest English proficiency rates in the world. No need to learn Dutch, though a "dank je wel" (thank you) is always
  appreciated.

  CULTURAL TIPS:
  - Cycling is the dominant form of transport — respect bike lanes, they have absolute priority over pedestrians
  - Dutch directness can feel blunt to other cultures — it is not rudeness, it is honesty
  - Tipping: 5-10% in restaurants is appreciated but not mandatory
  - Tolerance is a core cultural value — Amsterdam's liberal attitude is genuine, not performative
  - The Dutch are punctual — arriving late to appointments is considered disrespectful
  - "Gezelligheid" — the Dutch concept of coziness and togetherness — explains why brown cafés (bruine kroegen) are so central to social life

  TRANSPORTATION: Amsterdam has an excellent tram, metro, and bus system — use the OV-chipkaart. Cycling is the best way to explore the city and countryside — bike rentals everywhere. Intercity trains (NS)
  connect all Dutch cities efficiently and frequently. Thalys and Eurostar for international connections (Paris, London, Brussels). Schiphol Airport is a major European hub.

  SAFETY: One of the safest countries in the world. Very low crime. The main danger for tourists is being hit by a bicycle — always look both ways before crossing bike lanes. Petty theft possible in busy
  Amsterdam areas (Dam Square, Red Light District). Cannabis is tolerated in licensed coffeeshops — consumption elsewhere is technically illegal.
