DESTINATION: Indonesia (Bali)

  VISA: Citizens of 95+ countries (USA, EU, UK, Australia, Argentina, etc.) receive a Visa on Arrival at major airports — $35 USD, valid 30 days, extendable once for another 30 days. Other nationalities must
  apply for an e-visa before arrival. As of 2024, a new Tourism Levy of 150,000 IDR (~$10 USD) applies to Bali specifically.

  BEST TIME TO VISIT: April-October (dry season) — ideal for beaches, surfing, and outdoor activities. May-September is peak. November-March is wet season — lush and green with fewer crowds and lower prices,
  but daily rain showers are common.

  CURRENCY: Indonesian Rupiah (IDR). Cash is essential — carry IDR at all times. Exchange money at authorized money changers (not at airports — rates are poor). ATMs available widely. Budget: ~400,000-800,000
  IDR/day (~$25-50 USD) for comfortable mid-range travel; Bali is affordable for Western travelers.

  LANGUAGE: Bahasa Indonesia (official) and Balinese. English widely spoken in tourist areas of Bali (Seminyak, Ubud, Canggu, Kuta). Outside Bali, English is less common.

  CULTURAL TIPS:
  - Bali is predominantly Hindu — dress modestly and respectfully when visiting temples
  - Wear a sarong and sash at temple entrances (usually provided or rented for small fee)
  - Do not step over or disturb canang sari (flower offerings) on the ground
  - The left hand is considered unclean — use your right hand for giving and receiving
  - Bargaining is expected at markets; be respectful and good-humored
  - Cremation ceremonies are public and tourists may observe — dress modestly and ask permission before photographing

  TRANSPORTATION: Renting a scooter is the most popular and affordable way to get around Bali (~80,000 IDR/day). Grab app (motorbike or car) available in most areas — use it over street taxis. Metered taxis
  (Blue Bird) are reliable in Denpasar. For inter-island travel, domestic flights (Garuda, Lion Air) are necessary — Indonesia has 17,000 islands.

  SAFETY: Generally safe for tourists. Traffic is chaotic — exercise extreme caution on scooters. Bali belly (stomach illness from water/food) is common — drink only bottled water and eat at clean
  establishments. Petty theft occurs in crowded areas. Be aware of drink spiking in nightlife areas (Kuta, Seminyak). Never take drugs — Indonesia has severe penalties including the death penalty.
