 DESTINATION: Italy

  VISA: Italy is part of the Schengen Area. Citizens of the EU need only an ID. Citizens of USA, Canada, Australia, and Argentina do NOT need a visa for stays up to 90 days within a 180-day period. A Schengen
  visa is required for nationalities not on the exemption list.

  BEST TIME TO VISIT: April-June and September-October. Mild weather, fewer crowds, lower prices. July-August is peak season: hot, crowded, and expensive, especially in Rome, Florence, and Venice.
  December-February is off-season — cold but fewer tourists.

  CURRENCY: Euro (EUR). Credit cards widely accepted in cities. Carry some cash for smaller towns, markets, and local trattorias. Budget: ~80-150 EUR/day for mid-range travel.

  LANGUAGE: Italian. English spoken in tourist areas, hotels, and major restaurants. Outside big cities, English is less common — a few Italian phrases go a long way.

  CULTURAL TIPS:
  - Dress modestly when entering churches (cover shoulders and knees)
  - Lunch (12:30-2:30pm) and dinner (7:30pm+) are social events — rushing is frowned upon
  - "Coperto" (cover charge) on restaurant bills is normal, not a scam
  - Espresso is drunk standing at the bar — ordering cappuccino after noon marks you as a tourist
  - Avoid tourist trap restaurants near major monuments — walk one or two streets away
  - Validate train and bus tickets before boarding or risk fines

  TRANSPORTATION: Extensive train network (Trenitalia, Italo) connecting major cities. High-speed trains (Frecciarossa) for Rome-Milan-Florence. Local buses and ferries for smaller towns and islands. Renting a
   car is ideal for Tuscany countryside. Driving in city centers is discouraged (ZTL zones with cameras and fines).

  SAFETY: Generally safe for tourists. Pickpocketing is the main concern in crowded areas (Colosseum, Vatican, train stations). Use money belts, keep bags in front, and be aware of distraction scams.
