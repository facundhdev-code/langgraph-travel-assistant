DESTINATION: France

  VISA: Citizens of the EU need only an ID. USA, Canada, Australia, Argentina, and most Western countries do NOT need a visa for stays up to 90 days (Schengen Area). Other nationalities require a Schengen
  visa.

  BEST TIME TO VISIT: April-June and September-October. Pleasant weather, manageable crowds. July-August is peak season — hot, very crowded, and expensive, especially Paris. December is lovely for Christmas
  markets.

  CURRENCY: Euro (EUR). Credit cards widely accepted everywhere. Carry some cash for markets, bakeries, and rural areas. Budget: ~100-180 EUR/day for mid-range travel in Paris; less in the regions.

  LANGUAGE: French. English is spoken in hotels, tourist areas, and Paris broadly. Outside Paris, English is less common. A basic "Bonjour" and "Merci" go a long way — French people appreciate the effort.

  CULTURAL TIPS:
  - Always greet with "Bonjour" before any interaction — skipping it is considered rude
  - Lunch (12-2pm) and dinner (7:30-9pm) are sacred — kitchens close between meals
  - Tipping is not mandatory but rounding up or leaving 5-10% is appreciated
  - Dress neatly — French culture values appearance, especially in restaurants
  - Queuing is respected — do not push or cut in line
  - Many museums are free on the first Sunday of each month

  TRANSPORTATION: Excellent TGV high-speed train network connecting all major cities. Paris has an extensive Metro system. Renting a car is ideal for Provence, the Loire Valley, and rural regions. Taxis and
  Uber available in cities.

  SAFETY: Generally very safe. Pickpocketing is the main risk in Paris (Eiffel Tower, Louvre, Metro). Be aware of distraction scams near tourist monuments. Keep bags in front and avoid displaying valuables.
