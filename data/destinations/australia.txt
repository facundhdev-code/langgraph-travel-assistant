DESTINATION: Australia

  VISA: Almost all nationalities require a visa to enter Australia. Citizens of USA, Canada, EU, and UK can apply for an ETA (Electronic Travel Authority) — $20 AUD, valid 12 months, stays up to 90 days per
  visit. Citizens of Argentina and most Latin American countries need to apply for a Visitor Visa (subclass 600) — apply online at immi.homeaffairs.gov.au. New Zealand citizens are exempt.

  BEST TIME TO VISIT: Depends entirely on the region. Sydney and Melbourne: September-November and March-May (spring and autumn — mild and pleasant). Queensland and the Great Barrier Reef: April-October (dry
  season; avoid November-March — stinger season in the water). Uluru and the Outback: April-September (cooler). Northern Territory: April-October (dry season).

  CURRENCY: Australian Dollar (AUD). Cards accepted everywhere — Australia is very cashless. Tipping is not expected or mandatory but appreciated (5-10% for excellent service). Budget: ~150-250 AUD/day
  (~$95-160 USD) for mid-range travel — Australia is expensive.

  LANGUAGE: English. Australian slang is extensive and colorful — "arvo" (afternoon), "brekkie" (breakfast), "servo" (gas station), "no worries" (everything is fine).

  CULTURAL TIPS:
  - Australians are extremely relaxed and informal — first names immediately, no formalities
  - Tipping is genuinely optional — service workers earn a living wage
  - "Shout" culture — when in a group, each person takes a turn buying a round of drinks
  - Respect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their land is important
  - The sun is brutal — SPF 50+ sunscreen is not optional, especially in summer
  - Wildlife is genuinely dangerous — respect warnings about jellyfish, crocodiles, sharks, and snakes

  TRANSPORTATION: Domestic flights essential for long distances (Sydney to Perth is 5 hours). Greyhound and Premier Motor Service for intercity buses. Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane have good public transit
  (Opal, Myki cards). Renting a car essential outside major cities. Driving on the LEFT. Vast distances between attractions — plan carefully.

  SAFETY: Very safe country with low crime rates. The biggest dangers are natural: rip currents at beaches (swim between the flags), extreme UV radiation, bushfires (check alerts in summer), and wildlife.
  Follow all safety signage — it is there for good reason.
