DESTINATION: Portugal

  VISA: EU citizens need only an ID. USA, Canada, Australia, Argentina, and most Western countries do NOT need a visa for stays up to 90 days (Schengen Area). Other nationalities require a Schengen visa.

  BEST TIME TO VISIT: March-May and September-October. Mild weather, fewer crowds, lower prices. June-August is peak season — hot, crowded, and expensive, especially Lisbon and the Algarve. Lisbon and Porto
  are pleasant year-round.

  CURRENCY: Euro (EUR). Credit cards widely accepted. Carry some cash for pastelerias, local markets, and rural areas. Budget: ~70-130 EUR/day for mid-range travel — Portugal is one of Western Europe's most
  affordable destinations.

  LANGUAGE: Portuguese. English widely spoken in Lisbon, Porto, and tourist areas. The Algarve coast is very English-friendly due to British tourism. Brazilians will find communication easy.

  CULTURAL TIPS:
  - Fado music is a national treasure — attend a live Fado show in Lisbon's Alfama neighborhood
  - Lunch (12:30-2:30pm) is the main meal — "prato do dia" (daily special) is great value
  - Dinner starts around 7:30-8pm, later on weekends
  - Tipping is not mandatory but 5-10% is appreciated in restaurants
  - "Saudade" — the Portuguese feeling of nostalgic longing — permeates music, art, and culture
  - Pastel de nata (custard tart) from Pastéis de Belém is non-negotiable

  TRANSPORTATION: Excellent train network (CP — Comboios de Portugal) connecting Lisbon, Porto, and the Algarve. Rede Expressos buses for areas not covered by trains. Lisbon and Porto have good Metro systems.
  Renting a car is ideal for the Alentejo, Douro Valley, and rural Algarve. Uber available in Lisbon and Porto.

  SAFETY: One of the safest countries in Europe. Very low crime rate. Petty theft possible in Lisbon's crowded trams (especially Tram 28) and tourist areas. Lisbon's hilly cobblestone streets can be slippery —
   wear appropriate shoes.
