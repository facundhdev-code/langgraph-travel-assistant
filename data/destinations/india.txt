DESTINATION: India

  VISA: Almost all foreign nationals require a visa. Citizens of USA, EU, UK, Canada, Australia, Argentina, and most countries can apply for an e-Visa online — apply at least 4 business days before travel.
  e-Tourist Visa valid 30 days (double entry) or 1 year (multiple entry). Pakistanis and Bangladeshis have different requirements.

  BEST TIME TO VISIT: Varies significantly by region. North India (Delhi, Agra, Rajasthan): October-March (cool and dry). Kerala and South India: October-February (post-monsoon, green and pleasant). Goa:
  November-February (dry season, perfect beach weather). Himalayas: May-June and September-October. Avoid June-September (monsoon) for most regions unless you specifically want to experience it.

  CURRENCY: Indian Rupee (INR). Cash is still important — carry rupees at all times. UPI (Unified Payments Interface) is widely used locally but requires an Indian number. ATMs available in cities but can run
  out of cash. Budget: ~3,000-7,000 INR/day (~$35-85 USD) for comfortable mid-range travel — India offers extraordinary value.

  LANGUAGE: Hindi and English are official languages. English is widely spoken in tourist areas, hotels, and by educated urban population. India has 22 official languages and hundreds of dialects — Tamil in
  the south, Bengali in the east, etc.

  CULTURAL TIPS:
  - Remove shoes before entering temples, mosques, and many homes
  - Dress modestly — especially women; cover shoulders and legs at religious sites
  - Cows are sacred in Hinduism — never joke about or disrespect them
  - The head wobble (side-to-side) means yes, agreement, or acknowledgment
  - Bargaining is expected at markets — start at 40-50% of the asking price
  - Eat with your right hand — the left hand is considered unclean
  - Personal questions (Are you married? How much do you earn?) are normal conversation, not intrusive

  TRANSPORTATION: Indian Railways is one of the world's largest rail networks — book well in advance at irctc.co.in. IndiGo, Air India, and SpiceJet for domestic flights (essential for long distances). Uber
  and Ola available in cities. Auto-rickshaws for short distances — negotiate price first or insist on the meter. Never take unmarked taxis.

  SAFETY: Exercise common sense, particularly for solo female travelers — research specific destinations. Delhi Belly (stomach illness) is very common — drink only bottled water, avoid ice, and eat at clean
  establishments. Touts and scams targeting tourists are frequent — be firm but polite. Keep copies of all documents and have travel insurance that covers medical evacuation.
