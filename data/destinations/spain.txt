DESTINATION: Spain

  VISA: EU citizens need only an ID. USA, Canada, Australia, Argentina, and most Western countries do NOT need a visa for stays up to 90 days (Schengen Area). Other nationalities require a Schengen visa.

  BEST TIME TO VISIT: March-May and September-November. Mild weather, fewer crowds. June-August is very hot (especially inland and the south) and crowded on the coasts. December-February is ideal for cities
  like Seville and Barcelona.

  CURRENCY: Euro (EUR). Credit cards accepted almost everywhere. Cash useful for small tapas bars and local markets. Budget: ~80-150 EUR/day for mid-range travel.

  LANGUAGE: Spanish (Castilian). Catalan in Barcelona/Catalonia, Basque in the north, Galician in the northwest. English widely spoken in tourist areas and major cities.

  CULTURAL TIPS:
  - Lunch (2-4pm) is the main meal of the day — many restaurants only open then
  - Dinner starts late — 9pm is normal, 10-11pm common
  - Siesta is real in smaller towns — shops close 2-5pm
  - Tapas culture: in many bars, a small snack comes free with your drink
  - Never rush a meal — eating is a social event
  - Flamenco is from Andalusia specifically — not representative of all Spain

  TRANSPORTATION: Excellent AVE high-speed trains (Madrid-Barcelona ~2.5h). Renfe and Ouigo for intercity travel. Cities have good metro/bus systems. Renting a car ideal for Andalusia and rural areas. Low-cost
   flights (Vueling, Iberia) for island hopping.

  SAFETY: Very safe for tourists. Pickpocketing is the main concern in Barcelona (La Rambla, Metro), Madrid (Puerta del Sol), and busy beaches. Use crossbody bags and stay alert in crowded areas.
