DESTINATION: Peru

  VISA: Citizens of USA, EU, UK, Canada, Australia, Argentina, and most countries do NOT need a visa — stay up to 90 days (extendable to 183 days at immigration). Entry requires a valid passport and proof of
  onward travel.

  BEST TIME TO VISIT: May-October (dry season) — best for Machu Picchu, the Inca Trail, and Cusco. June-August is peak season: crowded but ideal weather. November-April is rainy season — Machu Picchu is open
  but trails can be muddy and views obscured. The Amazon jungle is accessible year-round; dry season (May-October) means easier wildlife spotting.

  CURRENCY: Peruvian Sol (PEN). Cash is essential outside Lima — ATMs limited in smaller towns. Carry small denominations (large bills hard to break). USD accepted in many tourist establishments but at poor
  rates. Budget: ~150-300 PEN/day (~$40-80 USD) for comfortable mid-range travel — Peru is good value.

  LANGUAGE: Spanish (official) and Quechua (co-official, widely spoken in the Andes). English spoken in Lima's Miraflores district, major hotels, and tourist sites like Machu Picchu. Outside Lima, Spanish is
  essential.

  CULTURAL TIPS:
  - Altitude sickness (soroche) is real — Cusco sits at 3,400m. Rest on arrival, drink coca tea, avoid alcohol for the first 24-48 hours
  - Machu Picchu requires advance booking — tickets sell out weeks ahead; reserve at machupicchu.gob.pe
  - Inca Trail permits sell out months in advance — book through a licensed operator
  - Peruvians are proud of their cuisine — Peruvian food is world-class and diverse
  - Bargaining acceptable at markets; fixed prices at established restaurants and shops
  - Tipping: 10% in restaurants (if no service charge); tip guides and porters directly

  TRANSPORTATION: LATAM Peru and Sky Airline for domestic flights (Lima-Cusco is the main route — 1.5h; the bus is 20+ hours). Cruz del Sur and Oltursa for luxury intercity buses. PeruRail and Inca Rail for
  the train to Machu Picchu (Cusco/Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calientes). Taxis in Lima — use Cabify, Beat, or InDriver apps over street taxis.

  SAFETY: Research specific areas. Lima's Miraflores and Barranco districts are safe and tourist-friendly. Cusco and the Sacred Valley are generally safe. Do not display expensive equipment. Express
  kidnappings occur in some Lima areas — use app-based taxis only. Altitude is the biggest health risk — acclimatize properly before trekking.
